# Ping Pong Championship Rules

## Article 1 - Committee Rulings
1. Any additional rules must be voted on and win by a 2/3 majority in order to be ratified.
2. In order to be a voting member, a player must meet *one* of the following requirements:
    1. Must be a member of the pongers-whiff-whaff slack channel

## Article 2 - Obtaining Championship Status
1. Championship matches are played best 3 out of 5, 2 serves each to eleven points as per the [ITTF Handbook](http://www.ittf.com/handbook/).
2. If a player bests their opponent by three consecutive games, they are obligated to offer a 'winner takes all' round. The winner of the 'winner takes all' round becomes the *CHAMPION*.

## Article 3 - Immunity & Forfeiture
1. If a player challenges the *CHAMPION*, the *CHAMPION* may do one of three things:
    1. Accept the challenge and place the title on the line. Backing out of an accepted challenge results in a forfeit.
    2. Defer the challenge. The current *CHAMPION* may defer a challenge until the next business day. Note that if the *CHAMPION* is out of office (OOO) the next day, the *CHAMPION* retains Championship status. Additionally, it is up to the challenger to re-initiate the challenge at a mutually agreed upon time. If a time cannot be agreed upon or work duties prevent the match from occurring, the *CHAMPION* retains *CHAMPION*ship status.
    3. Forfeit. Forfeiture immediately bestows the rights and privileges of *CHAMPION*ship status to the challenger.
2. Any non-*CHAMPION* challenges are called 'Exhibition Matches' and do not bestow any rights or privileges to the participants.
3. If the existing *CHAMPION* is OOO for 3 working days then they relinquish their Championship status. At this time, any two players can escalate an 'Exhibition Match' to a Championship match.
